# Test MultiAgent

To test if MultiAgent works well, you can simply run the script "test_multiagent.py"
and check the poping up results.

	[user @ ~] cd MultiAgent/tests
	[user @ MuliAgent/tests] source activate mas
	(mas)[user @ MuliAgent/tests] python test_multiagent.py
	...

* Make sure you have properly downloaded MultiAgent and create the developing environment "mas",
as instructed in "MuliAgent/README.md".
