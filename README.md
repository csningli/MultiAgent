# MultiAgent
MultiAgent is an open source framework for the simulation of the multiagent systems in the 2D plane.

# Features
- Agents are implemented as abstract controlling units. They can work without being associated
with any objects that have physical bodies.
- While running the simulation, all data will be automatically saved under the current working directory.
These data can be used to restore the simulation, and they are obviously the perfect resource for further
analysis.  

# Versions

## Version 2.0
At this time, the framework part of version 2.0 has been finished. The following works will focus on
completing it with more tests and examples that may help explaining how to use MultiAgent efficiently.

The tests will be tightly associated with version 2.0. However, the examples will be maintained to
work for all versions in series 2.

## Version 1.0
Version 1.0, the first version of MultiAgent still works as a standalone. No longer supported.

# Get Started
To use MultiAgent 2, please refer to "2/README.md" for the detailed instructions.
