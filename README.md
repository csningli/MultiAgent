# Versions

## Version 2.0
At this time, the framework part of version 2.0 has been finished. The following works will focus on 
completing it with more tests and examples that may help explaining how to use MultiAgent efficiently. 

The tests will be tightly associated with version 2.0. However, the examples will be maintained to 
work for all versions in series 2.

## Version 1.0
Version 1.0, the first version of MultiAgent still works as a standalone. However, there is no
further improvement or support for it.
